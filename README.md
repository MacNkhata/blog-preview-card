## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project has taught me mainly two things.

- Working with customs font files that are stored in the project. This far i only knew how to use either local fonts on the machine or importing one from Google fonts but this project I learnt how to import fonts in the project files.
- The second thing is the drop shadow. Using the box-shadow i did not know that one can also achieve something like that.

The other things were just a reminder and getting more practice on the concepts like:

- Flexbox: I used flexbox throughout the project and it helped me achieve the look that i was going for with simple and straightforward code.
- Working with images: It is always tough to arrange images in the way that one want without breaking the overall layout of the page.

### Continued development

I am planning to work more on projects that involve flexbox and javascript for interactions.
